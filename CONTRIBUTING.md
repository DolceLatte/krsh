### Setup

If you want to contribute code to KRSH, Fork KRSH first, then clone your repository.

```

After that, install pre-commit through the command below
```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

And make a branch with the appropriate name, commission it.
```bash

git add .
git commit
```
